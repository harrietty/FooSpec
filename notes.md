# Creating a RSpec Gem Clone

In this project I create a RSpec gem clone, adding functionality as I go. I will use RSpec to test it.

### Installing Rspec

In the Gemfile, add `gem "rspec", "~> 3.0"`.

The specifier ~> means that you will get the highest released version of the Gem between 3.0 and 4.0.

If you specified a minor version, e.g. "~> 3.1.0" you would get the highest released version between 3.1.0 and 3.2
